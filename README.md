# basic_pseudo_shell_in_python
A pseudo shell to improve my python skill's and understand more specifically what is a shell.

if you already have python3 (or python) and the python's library 'cmd', 'subprocess' in your pc,
launch it as:
python3 my_shell.py

it's a pseudo_shell so some input will not work correctly
